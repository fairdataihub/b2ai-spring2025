# Material of the "Open Data Sharing in the Era of AI: Challenges and Opportunities" presentation at the Bridge2AI Spring 2025 All Hands Meeting (May 20-21, 2025)

## About

This repository contains the material and information associated with our talk at the NIH Bridge2AI 2025 Spring All Hands meeting. Bhavesh Patel will give a talk titled "Open Data Sharing in the Era of AI: Challenges and Opportunities" as part of the Science Talks session. The talk will discuss what we coined as pseudo-reidentification risks and introduce a new swiss-cheese model of open data sharing.

The All Hands Conference (May 20-21) will be an opportunity for researchers and experts to engage in vibrant discussions. The NIH Common Fundâ€™s Bridge to Artificial Intelligence (Bridge2Al) program will propel biomedical research forward by setting the stage for widespread adoption of artificial intelligence (Al) that tackles complex biomedical challenges beyond human intuition. The biomedical research community generates a wealth of data, but most of these data are not suitable for machine learning because they are incomplete. By bringing technological and biomedical experts together with social scientists and humanists, the Bridge2Al program will help bring solutions to this deficit.
